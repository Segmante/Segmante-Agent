# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Core Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start the development server on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev

# Build the application for production
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm run start

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Generate/update Sensay API SDK from OpenAPI schema
npm run generate-sdk
```

## Project Architecture

This is Segmante, a Shopify AI Agent built with Next.js that integrates Shopify stores with Sensay AI platform to create intelligent product assistants.

### Key Components

1. **Shopify Integration**:
   - `src/lib/shopify/client.ts`: Shopify Admin API client
   - `src/components/shopify/connection-form.tsx`: Store connection UI
   - `src/app/api/shopify/`: Server-side API routes for CORS resolution

2. **AI Intelligence**:
   - `src/lib/sensay/product-sync.ts`: Product data synchronization service
   - `src/lib/sensay/replica-manager.ts`: AI replica session management
   - `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`: Intelligent chat interface

3. **Modern UI/UX**:
   - `src/components/floating-header.tsx`: Professional navigation
   - `src/app/(dashboard)/`: Dashboard, stores, chat, and settings pages
   - Built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS

### Key Dependencies

- **Next.js**: React framework with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests
- **React Syntax Highlighter**: For code highlighting in examples

### Authentication Flow

The application uses API key authentication to interact with the Sensay API:
- API keys can be provided via environment variable (`SENSAY_API_KEY_SECRET`)
- Or entered directly in the UI
- The client automatically creates or reuses a replica at runtime

### Data Flow

1. User inputs message in the chat interface
2. Application sends request to Sensay API using the SDK
3. For streaming responses, chunks are appended to the UI as they arrive
4. Chat history is managed in component state
