# UI Updates Summary

## Overview
Updated the Segmante application UI to display user replicas and knowledge bases with comprehensive management capabilities.

## New Components Created

### 1. `ReplicaService` (`src/lib/services/replica-service.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Service class to interact with Sensay API for replica and knowledge base management
- **Key Features**:
  - Fetch all replicas or filter by Shopify-specific replicas
  - Retrieve knowledge bases with metadata and product count extraction
  - Enrich data with replica names and detailed information

### 2. `ReplicaList` (`src/components/replica-list.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Display and manage AI replicas with selection functionality
- **Features**:
  - Show replica cards with detailed information
  - Replica selection for chat functionality
  - Display replica metadata (model, memory mode, tags, created date)
  - Shopify store connection indicators
  - Beautiful UI with gradients and status indicators

### 3. `KnowledgeBaseList` (`src/components/knowledge-base-list.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Display knowledge bases with detailed information and management actions
- **Features**:
  - Show knowledge base details (ID, status, replica UUID, product count)
  - Content preview of knowledge base text
  - Status indicators (READY, PROCESSING, ERROR)
  - Timestamps and metadata
  - Action buttons (View, Resync, Delete)

## Page Updates

- Maintains existing chat functionality

### Stores Page (`src/app/stores/page.tsx`)
**New Features Added**:
- ‚úÖ **Tabbed Navigation**: Three tabs (Store Connection, AI Replicas, Knowledge Bases)
- ‚úÖ **AI Replicas Tab**: Complete replica management interface
- ‚úÖ **Knowledge Bases Tab**: Detailed knowledge base listing with actions
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Store Connection**: Original functionality preserved

**Tab Details**:
1. **Store Connection Tab**: Original Shopify connection form and status
2. **AI Replicas Tab**: Display all replicas with detailed information
3. **Knowledge Bases Tab**: Show all knowledge bases with management actions

## API Enhancements

### New API Endpoint (`src/app/api/replicas/route.ts`)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/replicas`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `type=all`: Get all replicas
  - `type=shopify`: Get only Shopify-specific replicas
  - `type=knowledge`: Get all knowledge bases
- **Response**: JSON with success status and data

## Key Features Implemented

### üîç **Replica Management**
- Display replica UUID, name, description, and metadata
- Show associated Shopify store domain
- Model and memory mode information
- Tags and creation timestamps
- Active/inactive status indicators

### üìä **Knowledge Base Management**
- Knowledge base ID and replica association
- Content preview and status monitoring
- Product count extraction from knowledge base text
- Creation and update timestamps
- Status indicators (READY, PROCESSING, ERROR states)

### üé® **UI/UX Improvements**
- Professional dark theme with gradients
- Consistent card layouts with hover effects
- Loading states and empty states
- Badge system for status and metadata
- Responsive grid layouts
- Action buttons with proper icons

### üîß **Technical Implementation**
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Error handling and loading states
- Efficient API calls with caching considerations
- Component reusability and props configuration
- Integration with existing user session management

## Usage Examples

### Chat Page Usage
1. User visits `/chat`
2. Clicks "Select AI Replica" button
3. Views available Shopify replicas
4. Selects desired replica for chat
5. Current replica info displayed above chat interface
6. Can change replica using settings button

### Stores Page Usage
1. User visits `/stores`
2. Uses tab navigation to switch between:
   - **Store Connection**: Connect/manage Shopify stores
   - **AI Replicas**: View and manage all AI replicas
   - **Knowledge Bases**: View knowledge bases with IDs and details
3. Each tab provides relevant management capabilities

### API Usage
```bash
# Get all Shopify replicas
curl http://localhost:3000/api/replicas?type=shopify

# Get all knowledge bases
curl http://localhost:3000/api/replicas?type=knowledge

# Get all replicas
curl http://localhost:3000/api/replicas
```

## Testing Results

‚úÖ **Pages Load Successfully**: Both chat and stores pages compile and load without errors
‚úÖ **API Endpoints Working**: Replica and knowledge base APIs return data correctly
‚úÖ **UI Components Render**: All new components display properly with styling
‚úÖ **Data Integration**: Successfully fetches real data from Sensay API
‚úÖ **User Flow**: Complete user experience from replica selection to knowledge base management

## Data Structure Examples

### Replica Information Displayed:
- UUID (truncated for readability)
- Name and description
- Shopify domain connection
- LLM model (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- Memory mode (RAG, prompt caching)
- Tags (shopify domain, e-commerce, etc.)
- Creation date and status

### Knowledge Base Information Displayed:
- Knowledge Base ID
- Associated replica name and UUID
- Status (READY/PROCESSING/ERROR)
- Product count extracted from content
- Content preview (first 200 characters)
- Creation and update timestamps
- Management actions (View/Resync/Delete)

This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for managing AI replicas and knowledge bases with a professional, user-friendly interface.
